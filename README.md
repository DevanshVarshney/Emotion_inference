The above code uses PVCheetah API for audio to text transcription and then uses a simple logistic regression model for inference. The logistic regression model is limited by the lack of datasets for correct distress classification and might give random outputs for them. Currently a 4-gram model is used for the vectorization of the sentences. The hardware interface of the project is still under development.
